              When used in this Privacy Policy, the term 'personal information' has the meaning set out in the Privacy
              Act
              1988 (Cth) (‘Privacy Act’). In general terms, ‘personal information’ is information (whether fact or
              opinion) about
              an individual who is identified or reasonably identifiable from that information or other information
              combined with
              that information.
              <br><br>
              Some types of personal information are classified as 'sensitive information' or 'health information',
              which are
              subject to additional protections under the Privacy Act (e.g. information about your racial origin or
              health status).
